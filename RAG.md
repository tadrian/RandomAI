tadrian: can you do a c# app that embedds data into my local ollama model, 
I think you can use Microsoft.SemanticKernel, or maybe Microsoft.Extension.AI

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create a C# app that embeds data into your local Ollama model. Let me start by exploring the workspace and then research the best approach using the latest Microsoft tools. Let me first research the current state of Microsoft.Extensions.AI and Microsoft.SemanticKernel to understand the best approach for embedding data with Ollama. Perfect! I can see Microsoft.Extensions.AI now has first-class support for Ollama. Let me fetch the official Microsoft documentation and examples to get the latest approach. Now let me fetch the specific API documentation for OllamaEmbeddingGenerator to understand how to use it properly. Now let me fetch some examples from the official AI samples repository to see how to implement embedding functionality. Perfect! Now let me look at the actual embedding examples to understand the implementation pattern. Now let me fetch the actual TextEmbedding.cs example to see the implementation: Now let me also get the project file to understand the dependencies: Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me search for more advanced examples that show how to actually store and retrieve embeddings data, not just generate them. Excellent! Now let me fetch the RAG quickstart guide which should show how to store and retrieve embeddings: Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me also check for information about using Ollama specifically with this pattern: Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about how to create a C# app that embeds data into a local Ollama model using Microsoft.Extensions.AI and Microsoft.Extensions.VectorData. Let me create a comprehensive solution.

Based on my research, I'll create a C# application that demonstrates how to:
1. Generate embeddings using Ollama via Microsoft.Extensions.AI
2. Store embeddings in a vector store using Microsoft.Extensions.VectorData  
3. Perform semantic search on the embedded data
4. Create a practical RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application

Let me create the project step by step:

tadrian: can I use other models I have installed?

GitHub Copilot: I'll check what models you have available and show you how to modify the application to use different embedding models.

First, let me check what Ollama models you have installed: Great! You have several embedding models installed. I can see you have `nomic-embed-text` and `mxbai-embed-large` which are excellent embedding models. Let me show you how to modify the application to use different models and also create a configuration option to easily switch between them.

Let me research the specifications of these models: Perfect! I found that `nomic-embed-text` has 768 dimensions. Let me fetch more details about the mxbai-embed-large model: Let me get more specific information about the mxbai-embed-large dimensions: Excellent! Now I have the key information. Let me test what dimensions the actual models return on your system: Let me use PowerShell syntax instead: Let me test the mxbai model as well: Perfect! Now I have the exact dimensions. Let me update the memory file with this information and then modify the application to support multiple models: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me create a model configuration system for the application. First, I'll create a configuration class: 

Made changes.

Now I need to update the Document model to support variable dimensions. Since different models have different dimensions, I'll make the embedding size flexible: I need to make the vector field dynamic. Let me replace the fixed-dimension vector with a more flexible approach: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to update the EmbeddingService to support configurable models: 
```

```


Made changes.


```
I see the issue - my replacement didn't include the complete method. Let me fix this by reading the full method and replacing it correctly: I see the problem - there's an extra closing brace. Let me fix it: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to update the Program.cs to support model selection. Let me add a model selection feature: Let me add a model selection menu before initializing the service. First, let me look at the main method structure: Now I'll add a model selection method and update the initialization: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to add the SelectEmbeddingModel method. Let me add it at the end of the file: Let me find where the file ends and add the new method: Now I'll add the SelectEmbeddingModel method before the closing class brace: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to update the statistics display to show the current model information dynamically: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now I need to update the error message to be more generic since we support multiple models: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me also add a "Change Model" option to the main menu. Let me find the main menu: 
```
